## Installation steps

Download NodeJS from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) if you do not already have NodeJS installed (install version 20.16.0). npm comes packaged with NodeJS.

Make sure NodeJS is correctly installed by running:
```
npm -v
node -v
```

Install eslint:

```
npm install eslint
```

For VS Code, install the following extensions (will make development easier):
- ESLint
- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Pretty Typescript Errors
